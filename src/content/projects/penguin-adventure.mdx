## Premise
In Penguin Adventure, you play as a penguin who has had a few too many. With the festivities dying down, he must now brave the long walk home.
Barely able to stand, he must navigate the perils of the city, including cars, flying tomatoes, and runaway wrecking balls.

## Nonconventional Controls
The player controls the penguin by rhythmically tapping the left and right triggers on the controller.

## Contributions
Most aspects of the game were created by both myself and collaborator Liheng We as part of CTIN 532 at USC Games.

### Design
I contributed heavily to design, including preproduction and ideation, level design, and more.

### Programming
Technical work was shared, and some of my responsibilities included:

- Audio System Design and asset implementation
- Hazard programming
- Game System Programming
- Scene Management
- Logging for usability testing
- And More


## Audio Assets
The music and sound effects were created by Berklee College of Music student Cooper Navin through a collaboration between USC Games and Berklee.

Each level has a variation on the main theme, with varying instrumentation.



## Trailer
I created and edited the trailer, with footage recorded by myself and my teammate
