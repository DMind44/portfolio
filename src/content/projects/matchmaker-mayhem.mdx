## Premise
A cooperative race against time where you and your matchmaking partner try to match a selection of eligible singles before the deadline. Communication skills and chemistry are a must when trying to balance compatibility between traits, star signs, and location all while working with limited information.

## Ideation
This project was part of an exercies to create a game from randomly selected mechanics in our case:
1. Player vs Game interactivity model
2. Set collection
3. A race (against time)
4. Involving romance 

## Contributions
Matchmaker Mayhem was created as part of a class project with a team of 4 students, including myself.

I contributed to most parts of the development process, including:
- Asset ideation and creation in Canva
- Physical prototyping
- Rule and instruction writing
- Usability and playability testing
