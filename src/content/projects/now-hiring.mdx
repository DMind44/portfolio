## Premise
Play as job recruiters in the shadow government competing to get your cohorts hired, and you must stop at no end to do so -- even if it means digging up dirt on your coworkers applicants.

## Contributions
Now Hiring: Shadow Government was created as part of a class project with a team of 4 students, including myself.

I took on the role of the usability lead for the project, conducting player studies, recording usability and playability issues, and creating solutions with the rest of the team.

Additionally, I contributed to many other areas of the game's development including:
- Content creation: character, liability, and prompt card text
- Rules writing: I worked on the initial rules text and made edits with playtest data
- Initial ideation and design: see below for more info

## Initial Ideation
The original premise for Now Hiring: Shadow Government was a trolley problem oriented game where players had to resolve moral dilemmas with a cast of zany characters.

Initial testing showed that players didn't care much for the railroad map and trolley plot, but they were very invested in the humourous character cards.

We made the decision early on to switch tracks and remove the trolley aspect altogether, while focusing more heavily on the character driven improv style narrative.

Ultimately we landed on a job recruiting game, with a large "You're Hired" stamp for added immersion
