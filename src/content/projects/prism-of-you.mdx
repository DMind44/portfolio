## Premise
Prism of you is an emergent sandbox of emotional expression within the mysterious world of the Prism.

The emoes are physical manifestations of human emotions, living within the prism.

Players must balance the delicate system of the Prism through interactions with emoes, attention, expression, and more.

## Contributions
### Gameplay Systems
Prism of you has various interconnected systems, including emoes, charge, thoughts, and card collectibles, to name a few.
I contributed significantly to emoe presentation, charge management, and a variety of areas of the game systems.
### Input System
Along with another engineer, I contributed to the player input system of the game, migrating from the old Unity input events to the modern Input System.
### UI Implementation
I implemented many parts of the in-game journal based on the assets and design specifications of the director.
I also synced the achievements and collectibles with player actions and game events.
### Bugfixing
As a system heavy game, many emergent behaviors and bugs arise during development, sometimes entertaining but often in game-breaking ways.
As an engineer, I contributed to many bug fixes and system improvements while working closely with the QA specialist.


## Where to Play
Prism of You is available to wishlist on the Steam Store!
